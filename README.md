# Mobaxterm-Payloader
A Python payload maker that I originally made to text Mobaxterm servers.
# What is it?
The code generates a payload that opens the target's shell and reveals passwords to the attacker. Has one-line launch or a series of prompts.

# Disclaimer!!!
**Do not use the code in any illegal way!** I made it because my friend wanted me to test his Minecraft server.
# How to use
1. Download the files from the release you need.
2. Download required dependencies from the "required.txt" file using "pip install -r required.txt"
3. Run the script, follow instructions in terminal.
   If Python tells you that you don't have required libraries installed even though you do, try running the script with "python" instead of "python3". Example: instead of "python3 payloader.py" do "python payloader.py"

# Future Additions
This code is still being made, so I'll see what else I have to add!
